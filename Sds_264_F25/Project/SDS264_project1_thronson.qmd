For one reason or another, the statistics gods have blessed us with data of all of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama's entire tweet history during Obama's presidency. In this project we will explore the results of wrangling this data and utilizing it to create tons of interesting statistics, plots and graphs.

The x axis measures each month and spans from 05/2015 to 11/2016. The y axis measures the number of words tweeted and ranges from 10 to 155 words. The graph shows a significant variability in the number of words tweeted by month by both Barack and Michelle.

Our story begins with simply counting how many significant words were tweeted by both people across each recorded month. It's important to note that the term "significant words" can be defined as words that are not stopwords (ie: the, to, and, etc.), and words that are within dlpyr's word list package. This was done the because there were lots of stopwords and online links that were parsed into words during the data wrangling process that needed to be filtered out. Therefore, the words recorded in lots of the dataset are a very limited (but relevant) subset of the complete Twitter history of our former executive leaders.

We can see that there is a large variability within how much was tweeted by month for both Barack and Michelle, especially during 2015. Both people also seemed to tweet much less during the following year at their own respective rate.

# Most common words by month

```{r}
#| echo: false
tweets_words |>
  group_by(year, month) |>
  count(word) |>

#| echo: false

michelle_words |>

  slice_max(order_by = n, with_ties = F)
```

# Most common word pairs
Next, we see the most common words by month recorded for both Barack and Michelle (since the majority of tweets during this time period come from Michelle, the combined dataset isn't used here). The words most commonly used by Barack emit a sense of political activism, initiative and inspiration--including great, change, health, people, history, etc.. On the other hand, almost of all of Michelle's most commonly used words by month were "lady" (possibly in self-reference to her title as first lady)--not at exciting at all.

# Mood words of tweets
For the remaining two charts, we will solely be focusing on Barack's tweeting history to see if we can garner any further insights about his final 20 months as president. First we will be looking at a measure of "net proportional positivity" for each of our recorded months by appending either a positive and negative sentiment to a select subset of our words. We then add together the net sum of each sentiment (assuming that a positive word has a +1 value and a negative word has a -1 value) and dividing that number by the total number of words utilized in the calculation. What we find is an oddly positive sentiment from Baracks tweets across every single month with no net proportional sentiment dipping under 0.5 and many of them sitting at a proportion of 1.0. This could support the driven and fearless character that President Obama seems to have built his campaign off of as shown by his word choice in our previous charts. 


# Mood words of tweets
```{r}
#| echo: false
nrc_sentiments <- get_sentiments("nrc")

barack_words |>
  inner_join(nrc_sentiments) |>
  count(year, month, sentiment) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) |>
  mutate(
    sum_words = anger + anticipation + disgust + fear + joy + negative + positive + surprise + sadness + trust,
    anger = anger / sum_words,
    anticipation = anticipation / sum_words,
    disgust = disgust / sum_words,
    fear = fear / sum_words,
    joy = joy / sum_words,
    positive = positive / sum_words,
    negative = negative / sum_words,
    sadness = sadness / sum_words,
    surprise = surprise / sum_words,
    trust = trust / sum_words
  ) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(anger:trust),
    names_to = "sentiment",
    values_to = "prop"
  ) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = month, y = prop, fill = sentiment), position = "stack") +
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 2, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of different mood words in Barack Obama's tweets by month",
    subtitle = "(between May 2015 and November 2016)",
    caption = "**only contains words from the dplyr 'words' list**",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Proportion"
  )
```

Finally, we analyze a plethora of different moods of words by appending a much broader list of emotions to our list of words. We derive the same process from our previous chart by taking the proportion of each emotion used in the words of Barack's tweets and dividing it by the total amount of words tweeted within that month. The results show a surprisingly unwavering proportion of each emotion for each month, regardless of how many total words were tweeted out during that month, which could possibly allude to an unwavering character not easily influenced by outside events or conflicts.
